# OilSpill-Prediction

This project goal is to train a model that can identify the cause of an oil spill, such as equipment failure, human error,
natural disasters, or criminal activities. This information can be critical for oil spill response and clean-up efforts, as
the cause of the spill can have important implications for the best course of action to take.
